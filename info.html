    <h1 class="header1">DISCLAIMER</h1>

    <p>Me and my lawyer want to make it explicitly clear that our branding and the "bomb"
      button on the left in no way encourage or endorse violence, nor do they
      constitute any form of violent threat. <em>The bomb button is
      merely a tasteless joke.</em> The website admin does not wish to bomb anything.
      Thank you for understanding. xoxo</p>

    <h1 class="header1">STATE OF THE COMIC</h1>
    <p>Solar Sweep is being worked on. As of 21st of December, 2024, the prologue's script has finally been finished.
    This was a momentous occasion, as the prologue went through 4 or 5 different rewrites, and work on it lasted
    mode than a year. Now, since I passed that obstacle, concept art is being drawn, storyboards are being laid up,
    3d assets are being modelled, and panels should soon be finished. Will be seeing y'all soon, with <em>"FIRECRACKER"</em>, the prologue of Solar Sweep.</p>
