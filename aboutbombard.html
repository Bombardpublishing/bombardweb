    <h1>BOMBARD PUBLISHING</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Bombard Publishing is an unregistered entity ran from a bunker in Bucharest,
      Romania, by Pavel. It currently troubles itself with publishing Solar Sweep,
      and has as its highest priority the production of peak kino.

    <p>
      Bombard Publishing is in a superposition of 300 different potential outcomes.
      I may end up achieving something cool with it. It may die within 2 months.
      It is an unstable bomb, built from scratch by a madman. You may lose fingers
      handling it. Which is why I thank you for sticking by, regardless of how
      scuffed things are right now.</p>
    <p>
      Thank you for giving Bombard Publishing a chance. </p>
